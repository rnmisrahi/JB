WCF

This is a way to standardize the communication between computers.
One can change the protocol without changing the machine's way of communicating, except telling it that we'll communicate through another protocol/
This is done through something called Binding.
It takes the End Point to where it communicates: It includes the port number

When doing a web service, include the reference ServiceModel

Interfaces need [ServiceContract]
The methods need [OperationContract]


ServiceHost is the class that will help to host the service
on Main() we do:
ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(StockService)); //StockService is the class of the service
host.AddServicEndPoint



CLIENT

Create Interface
Copy the interface from the server
It also uses Systm.ServiceModel

Main()
ICurrency service=ChannelFactory<ICurrency>.CreateChannel(
  new BasicHttpBinding(),
  "http://localhost:910/Stosvc");
  host.Open();
  

)
