- Binding is always done to functions (hence Get is needed)

- DataContext: When there system doesn't find the source, it loos for it in DataCOntext

- Binding also has a default. After of the constructorter the word Binding, we pass on the parameter. When we declare something in XAML we're newing something.

- Converter is used when we pass info from source to target and back during Binding.



* Do same stuff but with just a List<Member> with some 3 members.
